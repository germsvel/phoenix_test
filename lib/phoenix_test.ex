defmodule PhoenixTest do
  @moduledoc """
  PhoenixTest provides a unified way of writing feature tests -- regardless of
  whether you're testing LiveView pages or static pages.

  It also handles navigation between LiveView and static pages seamlessly. So, you
  don't have to worry about what type of page you're visiting. Just write the
  tests from the user's perspective.

  Thus, you can test a flow going from static to LiveView pages and back without
  having to worry about the underlying implementation.

  This is a sample flow:

  ```elixir
  test "admin can create a user", %{conn: conn} do
    conn
    |> visit("/")
    |> click_link("Users")
    |> fill_in("Name", with: "Aragorn")
    |> choose("Ranger")
    |> assert_has(".user", text: "Aragorn")
  end
  ```

  Note that PhoenixTest does _not_ handle JavaScript. If you're looking for
  something that supports JavaScript, take a look at
  [Wallaby](https://hexdocs.pm/wallaby/readme.html).

  ## Setup

  PhoenixTest requires Phoenix `1.7+` and LiveView `0.20+`. It may work with
  earlier versions, but I have not tested that.

  ### Installation

  Add `phoenix_test` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      {:phoenix_test, "~> 0.4.2", only: :test, runtime: false}
    ]
  end
  ```

  ### Configuration

  In `config/test.exs` specify the endpoint to be used for routing requests:

  ```elixir
  config :phoenix_test, :endpoint, MyAppWeb.Endpoint
  ```

  ### Getting `PhoenixTest` helpers

  `PhoenixTest` helpers can be included via `import PhoenixTest`.

  But since each test needs a `conn` struct to get started, you'll likely want
  to set up a few things before that.

  There are two ways to do that.

  ### With `ConnCase`

  If you plan to use `ConnCase` solely for `PhoenixTest`, then you can import
  the helpers there:

  ```elixir
  using do
    quote do
      # importing other things for ConnCase

      import PhoenixTest

      # doing other setup for ConnCase
    end
  end
  ```

  ### Adding a `FeatureCase`

  If you want to create your own `FeatureCase` helper module like `ConnCase`,
  you can copy the code below which can be `use`d from your tests (replace
  `MyApp` with your app's name):

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyAppWeb.FeatureCase do
    use ExUnit.CaseTemplate

    using do
      quote do
        use MyAppWeb, :verified_routes

        import MyAppWeb.FeatureCase

        import PhoenixTest
      end
    end

    setup tags do
      pid = Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.start_owner!(MyApp.Repo, shared: not tags[:async])
      on_exit(fn -> Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.stop_owner(pid) end)

      {:ok, conn: Phoenix.ConnTest.build_conn()}
    end
  end
  ```

  Note that we assume your Phoenix project is using Ecto and its phenomenal
  `SQL.Sandbox`. If it doesn't, feel free to remove the `SQL.Sandbox` code
  above.

  ## Usage

  Now that we have all the setup out of the way, we can create tests like
  this:

  ```elixir
  # test/my_app_web/features/admin_can_create_user_test.exs

  defmodule MyAppWeb.AdminCanCreateUserTest do
    use MyAppWeb.FeatureCase, async: true

    test "admin can create user", %{conn: conn} do
      conn
      |> visit("/")
      |> click_link("Users")
      |> fill_in("Name", with: "Aragorn")
      |> fill_in("Email", with: "aragorn@dunedain.com")
      |> click_button("Create")
      |> assert_has(".user", text: "Aragorn")
    end
  end
  ```

  ### Filling out forms

  We can fill out forms by targetting their inputs, selects, etc. by label:

  ```elixir
  test "admin can create user", %{conn: conn} do
    conn
    |> visit("/")
    |> click_link("Users")
    |> fill_in("Name", with: "Aragorn")
    |> select("Elessar", from: "Aliases")
    |> choose("Human") # <- choose a radio option
    |> check("Ranger") # <- check a checkbox
    |> click_button("Create")
    |> assert_has(".user", text: "Aragorn")
  end
  ```

  For more info, see `fill_in/3`, `select/3`, `choose/3`, `check/2`,
  `uncheck/2`.

  ### Submitting forms without clicking a button

  Once we've filled out a form, you can click a button with
  `click_button/2` to submit the form. But sometimes you want to emulate what
  would happen by just pressing <Enter>.

  For that case, you can use `submit/1` to submit the form you just filled
  out.

  ```elixir
  session
  |> fill_in("Name", with: "Aragorn")
  |> check("Ranger")
  |> submit()
  ```

  For more info, see `submit/1`.

  ### Targeting which form to fill out

  If you find yourself in a situation where you have multiple forms with the
  same labels (even when those labels point to different inputs), then you
  might have to scope your form-filling.

  To do that, you can scope all of the form helpers using `within/3`:

  ```elixir
  session
  |> within("#user-form", fn session ->
    session
    |> fill_in("Name", with: "Aragorn")
    |> check("Ranger")
    |> click_button("Create")
  end)
  ```

  For more info, see `within/3`.
  """

  alias PhoenixTest.ConnHandler
  alias PhoenixTest.Driver

  @doc """
  Entrypoint to create a session.

  `visit/2` takes a `Plug.Conn` struct and the path to visit.

  It returns a `session` which the rest of the `PhoenixTest` functions can use.

  Note that `visit/2` is smart enough to know if the page you're visiting is a
  LiveView or a static view. You don't need to worry about which type of page
  you're visiting.
  """

  Clicks a link with given text (using a substring match) and performs the
  action.

  Here's how it handles different types of `a` tags:

  - With `href`: follows it to the next page
  - With `phx-click`: it'll send the event to the appropriate LiveView
  - With live redirect: it'll follow the live navigation to the next LiveView
  - With live patch: it'll patch the current LiveView

  ## Examples

  ```heex
  <.link href="/page/2">Page 2</.link>
  <.link phx-click="next-page">Next Page</.link>
  <.link navigate="next-liveview">Next LiveView</.link>
  <.link patch="page/details">Page Details</.link>
  ```

  ```elixir
  session
  |> click_link("Page 2") # <- follows to next page

  session
  |> click_link("Next Page") # <- sends "next-page" event to LiveView

  session
  |> click_link("Next LiveView") # <- follows to next LiveView

  session
  |> click_link("Page Details") # <- applies live patch
  ```

  ## Submitting forms

  Phoenix allows for submitting forms on links via Phoenix.HTML's `data-method`,
  `data-to`, and `data-csrf`.

  We can use `click_link` to emulate Phoenix.HTML.js and submit the
  form via data attributes.

  But note that this _doesn't guarantee_ the JavaScript that handles form
  submissions via `data` attributes is loaded. The test emulates the behavior
  but you must make sure the JavaScript is loaded.

  For more on that, see https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.html#module-javascript-library

  ### Example

  ```html
  <a href="/users/2" data-method="delete" data-to="/users/2" data-csrf="token">
    Delete
  </a>
  ```

  ```elixir
  session
  |> click_link("Delete") # <- will submit form like Phoenix.HTML.js does
  ```
  """

  @doc """

  See `click_link/2` for more details.
  """
  defdelegate click_link(session, selector, text), to: Driver

  @doc """
  Perfoms action defined by button with given text (using a substring match).
  The action is based on attributes present.

  This can be used in a number of ways.

  ## Button with `phx-click`

  If the button has a `phx-click` on it, it'll send the event to the LiveView.

  ### Example

  ```html
  <button phx-click="save">Save</button>
  ```

  ```elixir
  session
  |> click_button("Save") # <- will send "save" event to LiveView
  ```

  ## Button relying on Phoenix.HTML.js

  If the button acts as a form via Phoenix.HTML's `data-method`, `data-to`, and
  `data-csrf`, this will emulate Phoenix.HTML.js and submit the form via data
  attributes.

  But note that this _doesn't guarantee_ the JavaScript that handles form
  submissions via `data` attributes is loaded. The test emulates the behavior
  but you must make sure the JavaScript is loaded.

  For more on that, see https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_html/Phoenix.HTML.html#module-javascript-library

  ### Example

  ```html
  <button data-method="delete" data-to="/users/2" data-csrf="token">Delete</button>
  ```

  ```elixir
  session
  |> click_button("Delete") # <- will submit form like Phoenix.HTML.js does
  ```

  ## Combined with `fill_in/3`, `select/3`, etc.

  This function can be preceded by filling out a form.

  ### Example

  ```elixir
  session
  |> fill_in("Name", name: "Aragorn")
  |> check("Human")
  |> click_button("Create")
  ```

  ### Submitting default data

  By default, using `click_button/2` will submit the form it's part of (so long
  as it has a `phx-click`, `data-*` attrs, or an `action`).

  It will also include any hidden inputs and default data (e.g. inputs with a
  `value` set and the button's `name` and `value` if present).

  ### Example

  ```html
  <form method="post" action="/users/2">
    <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="true"/>
    <button name="complete" value="true">Complete</button>
  </form>
  ```

  ```elixir
  session
  |> click_button("Complete")
  # ^ includes `%{"admin" => "true", "complete" => "true"}` in payload
  ```

  ## Single-button forms

  `click_button/2` is smart enough to use a hidden input's value with
  `name=_method` as the method to send (e.g. when we want to send `delete`,
  `put`, or `patch`)

  That means, it is helpful to submit single-button forms.

  ### Example

  ```html
  <form method="post" action="/users/2">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete" />
    <button>Delete</button>
  </form>
  ```

  ```elixir
  session
  |> click_button("Delete") # <- Triggers full form delete.
  ```

  If the form is a LiveView form, and if the form has a `phx-change` attribute
  defined, `fill_in/3` will trigger the `phx-change` event.

  ## Options

  - `with` (required): the text to fill in.

  - `exact`: whether to match label text exactly. (Defaults to `true`)

  ## Examples

  Given we have a form that contains this:

  ```html
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input id="name" name="name"/>
  ```

  or this:

  ```html
  <label>

  ## Complex labels

  If we have a complex label, you can use `exact: false` to target part of the
  label.

  ### Example

  Given the following:

  ```html
  <label for="name">Name <span>*</span></label>
  <input id="name" name="name"/>

  ## Options

  - `from` (required): the label of the select dropdown.

  - `exact`: whether to match label text exactly. (Defaults to `true`)

  - `exact_option`: whether to match the option's text exactly. (Defaults to `true`)

  ## Inside a form

  If the form is a LiveView form, and if the form has a `phx-change` attribute
  defined, `select/3` will trigger the `phx-change` event.

  This can be followed by a `click_button/3` or `submit/1` to submit the form.

  ### Example

  Given we have a form that contains this:

  ```html
  <form>
    <label for="race">Race</label>
    <select id="race" name="race">
      <option value="human">Human</option>
      <option value="elf">Elf</option>
      <option value="dwarf">Dwarf</option>
      <option value="orc">Orc</option>
    </select>
  </form>
  ```

  We can select an option:

  ```elixir
  session
  |> select("Human", from: "Race")
  ```

  ## Outside a form

  If the select dropdown exists outside of a form, `select/3` will trigger the
  `phx-click` event associated to the option being selected (note that all
  options must have a `phx-click` in that case).

  ### Examples

  Given we have a form that contains this:

  ```html
  <label for="race">Race</label>
  <select id="race" name="race">
    <option phx-click="select-race" value="human">Human</option>

  ## Example

  Consider a form containig the following:

  ```heex
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Do you like Elixir:</legend>

    <div>
      <input name="elixir-yes" type="radio" id="elixir-yes" value="yes" />
      <label for="elixir-yes">Yes</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <input name="elixir-no" type="radio" id="elixir-no" value="no" />
      <label for="elixir-no">No</label>
    </div>
  </fieldset>

  <fieldset>
    <legend>Do you like Erlang:</legend>

    <div>
      <input name="erlang-yes" type="radio" id="erlang-yes" value="yes" />
      <label for="erlang-yes">Yes</label>

      <label for="erlang-no">No</label>
    </div>
  </fieldset>
  ```

  Since all radio buttons have the labels "Yes" or "No", you can target a
  specific radio button like so:

  ```elixir
  session
  |> choose("#elixir-yes", "Yes")
  ```

  Upload a file.

  If the form is a LiveView form, this will perform a live file upload.

  This can be followed by a `click_button/3` or `submit/1` to submit the form.

  ## Options

  - `exact`: whether to match the entire label. (Defaults to `true`)

  ## Examples

  Given we have a form that contains this:

  ```html
  <label for="avatar">Avatar</label>
  <input type="file" id="avatar" name="avatar" />
  ```

  We can upload a file:

  ```elixir
  session
  |> upload("Avatar", "/path/to/file")
  ```

  ## Complex labels

  If we have a complex label, you can use `exact: false` to target part of the
  label.

  ```html
  <label for="avatar">Avatar <span>*</span></label>
  <input type="file" id="avatar" name="avatar" />

  Helper to submit a pre-filled form without clicking a button (see `fill_in/3`,
  `select/3`, `choose/3`, etc. for how to fill a form.)

  Forms are typically submitted by clicking buttons. But sometimes we want to
  emulate what happens when we submit a form hitting <Enter>. That's what this
  helper does.

  If the form is a LiveView form, and if the form has a `phx-submit` attribute
  defined, `submit/1` will trigger the `phx-submit` event. Otherwise, it'll
  submit the form regularly.

  If the form has a submit button with a `name` and `value`, `submit/1` will
  also include that data in the payload.

  ## Example

  ```elixir
  session
  |> fill_in("Name", with: "Aragorn")
  |> select("Human", from: "Race")
  |> choose("Email")
  |> submit()

  Escape hatch to give users access to underlying "native" data structure.

  Once the unwrapped actions are performed, PhoenixTest will handle redirects
  (if any).

  - In LiveView tests, `unwrap/2` will pass the `view` that comes from
  Phoenix.LiveViewTest `live/2`. Your action _must_ return the result of a
  `render_*` LiveViewTest action.

  - In non-LiveView tests, `unwrap/2` will pass the `conn` struct. And your
  action _must_ return a `conn` struct.

  Assert helper to ensure an element with given CSS selector is present.

  - `text`: the text filter to look for.

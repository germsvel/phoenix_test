defmodule PhoenixTest do
  @moduledoc """
    PhoenixTest provides a unified way of writing feature tests -- regardless of
    whether you're testing LiveView pages or static pages.

    It also handles navigation between LiveView and static pages seamlessly. So, you
    don't have to worry about what type of page you're visiting. Just write the
    tests from the user's perspective.

    Thus, you can test a flow going from static to LiveView pages and back without
    having to worry about the underlying implementation.

    This is a sample flow:

    ```elixir
    test "admin can create a user", %{conn: conn} do
      conn
      |> visit("/")
      |> click_link("Users")
      |> fill_form("#user-form", name: "Aragorn", email: "aragorn@dunedan.com")
      |> click_button("Create")
      |> assert_has(".user", "Aragorn")
    end
    ```

    Note that PhoenixTest does _not_ handle JavaScript. If you're looking for
    something that supports JavaScript, take a look at
    [Wallaby](https://hexdocs.pm/wallaby/readme.html).

  Perfoms action defined by button.

  - If the button has a `phx-click` on it, it'll send the event to the LiveView.

  - If the button doesn't have a `phx-click` on it, it'll submit the parent form.

  This function can be preceded by `fill_form` to fill out a form and
  subsequently submit the form. Note that `fill_form/3` + `click_button/2` works
  for both static and live pages.

  If `click_button/2` is used alone (without a `phx-click`), it is assumed it is
  a form with a single button (e.g. "Delete").

  ## Examples

  ```elixir
  # form with single button or button with `phx-click`
  session
  |> click_button("Delete")

  # fill out form and then submit
  session
  |> fill_form("#user-form", name: "Aragorn")
  |> click_button("Create")

  Fills form data, validating that input fields are present.

  This can be used by both static and live pages.

  If the form is a LiveView form, and if the form has a `phx-change` attribute
  defined, `fill_form/3` will trigger the `phx-change` event.

  This can be followed by a `click_button/3` to submit the form.

  ## Examples

  ```elixir
  session
  |> fill_form("#user-form", name: "Aragorn")
  |> click_button("Create")
  ```

  If your form has nested data -- for example, with an input such as `<input
  name="user[email]">` -- you can pass a nested map as the last argument:

  ```elixir
  session
  |> fill_form("#user-form", user: %{email: "aragorn@dunedain.com"})
  |> click_button("Create")

  Submits form in the same way one would do by pressing `<Enter>`.

  _Note that this does not validate presence of the submit button._

  In the case of LiveView forms, it'll submit the form with LiveView's
  `phx-submit` event.

  If it's a static form, this is equivalent to filling the form and submitting
  it with the form's `method` and to the form's `action`.

  Note: if your form has a submit button, it's recommended you test with
  `fill_form/3` + `click_button/2` instead.
